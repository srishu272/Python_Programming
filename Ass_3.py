Practical:
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]). Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water. Return the maximum amount of water a container can store. Notice that you may not slant the container.
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49. Example 2:
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1"""

def maxArea(A, Len) :
     area = 0
     for i in range(Len) :
         for j in range(i + 1, Len) :
             area = max(area, min(A[j], A[i]) * (j - i))
    
     return area

a = [int(n) for n in input("Enter an array: ").split()]

len1 = len(a)
print(maxArea(a, len1))
